# Live Demo Hub

Welcome to the **Live Demo Hub**, where you can explore and interact with various project demos. This repository showcases both **frontend** and **fullstack** projects, allowing you to get a sense of what each offers.

## üìÇ Projects

### Frontend Projects
Frontend projects focus on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). These projects primarily involve designing how a website looks and feels, and how users interact with it.

  - Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, Next

Explore our frontend project demos:

- [Project 2 - Interactive sites - B](https://frontend-templates-b.vercel.app/)

### Fullstack Projects (Coming Soon)
Fullstack projects include both frontend and backend development. These projects handle the entire flow of data, from how users interact with the interface to how the system processes and responds to requests behind the scenes.

- **Features:**
  - Frontend + backend integration
  - Database management
  - Server-side logic and APIs
  - Technologies: Node.js, Next.js, SQL/NoSQL Databases, APIs

Stay tuned for fullstack project demos, coming soon!

## üîç What‚Äôs the Difference?

- **Frontend Projects:** 
  Focus purely on the visuals and interactions that users experience. They involve building what the user sees and engages with on a website.

- **Fullstack Projects:** 
  Handle both the **frontend** (what users see) and the **backend** (how data is stored, managed, and processed). Fullstack projects offer a complete solution by integrating the UI with data management and server logic.
